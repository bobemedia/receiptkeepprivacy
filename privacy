# Privacy Policy — ReceiptKeep

_Last updated: September 2025_

ReceiptKeep (“the App”) is provided by **Bobé Media** (“we”, “us”, “our”).

We respect your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, why, and your choices.

## Information We Collect

### Receipts & Metadata
- Receipts you add (store name, dates, amounts, categories, tags, notes) are saved **locally on your device** and, if you enable iCloud, synced via **Apple CloudKit** to your private iCloud container. We cannot access your personal iCloud data.

### Images
- Receipt photos you choose or scan are stored locally and may sync via iCloud if enabled.

### Purchases
- We use **RevenueCat** to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat receives purchase receipts and an anonymous user identifier in order to verify entitlements. See RevenueCat’s privacy policy.

### Diagnostics
- Basic, anonymous logs may be collected to help us troubleshoot crashes or subscription issues (e.g., error codes). We do not build profiles or sell data.

## How We Use Data
- Provide core features (storing receipts, search, reminders).
- Verify Pro subscription and restore purchases across devices.
- Improve reliability and fix bugs.

## Data Sharing
- **Apple**: iCloud/CloudKit for sync; StoreKit for purchases.
- **RevenueCat**: purchase validation and entitlement management.
- We do **not** sell personal data. We do not share data with advertisers.

## Your Choices
- You can use the App entirely offline without iCloud sync.
- You can delete receipts and photos at any time inside the App.
- Deleting the App removes local data from your device.
- To remove iCloud data, use **Settings ▸ Apple ID ▸ iCloud ▸ Manage Storage ▸ ReceiptKeep**.

## Children
ReceiptKeep is not intended for children under 13.

## Changes
We may update this policy as the App evolves. Material changes will be noted in the App and on our policy page.
